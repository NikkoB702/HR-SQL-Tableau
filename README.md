HR analytics has become an increasingly important tool for businesses, as companies seek to leverage data to optimize their workforce and make more informed decisions. As part of my QA testing efforts, I created a HR database in Postgres SQL and wrote SQL queries to test each feature and ensure the accuracy and quality of the data.

I utilized a variety of SQL functions, including SELECT, INSERT, COPY, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, CROSSTAB(), CAST(), ROUND(), and SUBQUERIES, to analyze the data and create visualizations in Tableau Desktop. The resulting HR analytics dashboard provides businesses with a comprehensive view of their workforce, including insights into employee demographics, performance metrics, and retention rates.

For businesses, this HR analytics dashboard can be an important tool for making informed decisions about staffing, promotions, and employee retention. By providing insights into key workforce metrics, businesses can optimize their workforce and ensure that they have the right people in the right positions.

For individuals interested in learning more about HR analytics, my code and data visualizations are available on my GitHub repository. The project demonstrates the power of SQL and Tableau in analyzing and visualizing complex datasets, and provides a roadmap for anyone interested in leveraging data to make more informed decisions about their workforce.

## Getting Started

To use the HR analytics dashboard, you will need to have access to the HR database in Postgres SQL and a licensed version of Tableau Desktop. Once you have access to the database, you can run the SQL queries to analyze the data and create the visualizations in Tableau Desktop.

## Usage

To use the HR analytics dashboard, simply open the Tableau workbook and explore the various visualizations. You can filter the data by employee demographics, performance metrics, and retention rates to gain insights into your workforce and make more informed decisions about staffing, promotions, and employee retention.

## Dataset

The HR dataset used in this project is proprietary data, and cannot be shared publicly. However, the SQL queries and Tableau visualizations can be used as a roadmap for analyzing and visualizing HR data in other organizations.

Overall, my HR analytics dashboard demonstrates the power of SQL and Tableau in analyzing and visualizing complex datasets, and provides businesses with the insights they need to optimize their workforce and make more informed decisions.
