# HR-SQL-Tableau

Welcome to my HR analytics dashboard project! As part of my QA testing efforts, I created a HR database in Postgres SQL and wrote SQL queries to test each feature and ensure the accuracy and quality of the data. üîç I utilized a variety of SQL functions, including SELECT, INSERT, COPY, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, CROSSTAB(), CAST(), ROUND(), and SUBQUERIES, to analyze the data and create visualizations in Tableau Desktop. üìä In addition, I created a test document containing screenshots and queries used to test the reports. üíª If you're interested in learning more about the technical aspects of the project, check out my code and data visualizations. #HRAnalytics #PostgresSQL #SQLQueries #DataVisualization #FunctionalValidation #DataValidation
